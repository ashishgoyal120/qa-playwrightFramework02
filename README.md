qa-playwrightFramework02
This is a Playwright-based test automation framework designed to demonstrate how to preserve session information using storage state.

üìÅ Folder Structure
1. node_modules
Auto-generated folder containing all the project dependencies.

2. distReports
Custom folder created to store HTML or other test execution reports.

3. playwright/.auth
Custom folder used to save the session or storage state.

Created manually for authentication storage.

4. tests
Contains all test case files.

When you run npx playwright test --headed, all tests under this folder will execute in headed mode.

5. Utils
Contains helper and setup utilities for the framework.

auth.setup.ts
This file performs two key tasks:

Saving the storage state (to avoid logging in repeatedly).

Verifying a successful API response using the function waitForSuccessFulResponse.

üîç Understanding waitForSuccessFulResponse
<pre lang="markdown"> 
export async function waitForSuccessFulResponse(page: Page): Promise<Response> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timeout waiting for dashboard response")), 15000);

    page.on('response', async (res) => {
      if (res.url().endsWith('/dashboard/index') && res.status() === 200) {
        resolve(res);
      }
    });
  });
}
</pre>
‚úÖ What This Function Does:
Listens for a successful HTTP response on the /dashboard/index endpoint.

Ensures that the response has a status code 200 (OK).

Used as a way to confirm successful login or application readiness.

üß™ How We Identify the Right API Response
Manually log in to the application.

Enter username and password.

Click the login button.

Open DevTools Inspector ‚Üí Go to the Network tab.

Clear filters and reload the page.

Click on any API call (like /dashboard/index) in the Name column.

On the right panel, observe the tabs: Headers, Preview, Response, etc.

From the Headers, note the API path (not the full URL).

We use this path (e.g., /dashboard/index) in our code to validate successful login via its 200 response.
